This CMS is a project I worked on for my course in "Web Technologies" at the Technological University of Denmark, spring semester 2020.
I don't consider it a completely finished product, although the sofware works quite well, without any bugs that I can find. I've been using it on https://gregorj.org since completion.

If you want to use this software, there are a few minor modifications you need to make: namely db information in db.php.
First of all, db.php needs to be placed OUTSIDE the root folder for it to work (and for security reasons, obviously). You also need a MySQL database with the following tables:

articles:
    id/pubDate/title/permalink/summary/content/category/author

users:
    id/username/password/email/rand

likes:
    id/article_id/ip_address

I know, that identifying users by ip address (for the likes) isn't the ideal, but I wanted to stick to my commitment NOT to use cookies (you can see the privacy statement on my site), and truth be told, it's a small site with very few viewers, so I can't imagine that like-spamming will be a problem. Yet.
